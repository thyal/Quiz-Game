## Quiz game

This a quiz game, loosely based on Kahoot (kahoot.it). The project was for an exam in my bachelor course. It allows players to connect to a room (or quiz game), and answer questions. They get scored based on if the answer is right, and the time they use.

The back-end is written in Node.js, and the fron-end in React.
